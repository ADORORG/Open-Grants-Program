## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

Please provide the following:
  * We are building an agnostic hub for Defi & NFT creation.

  * We take a unique approach where we will cater to traditional creatives and give them the spotlight they deserve to succeed.
  * Mass adoption & financial equality is the mission. We want to see creatives earn a living and the respective community benefit from their success.
